# Dad-Joke-Generator

An app that lets people view and vote on cheesy jokes using the ICanHazDadJoke API.

The Website lists the jokes, along with a “vote-up” button, a “vote-down” button, and the net score (up - down) for each joke. Users can vote, and the net score will update.
Jokes will reorder based on the number of votes they have!
